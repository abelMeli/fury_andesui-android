# Andes Accessibility Playground

This new feature is created for the devs who still are not fully introduced in the accessibility field,
and want to inspect the tools that Android makes available to us.

The playground has one activity/layout for each Android API, and since most of this APIs are available
to use both from xml and code, we will find examples in the xml layout and in the activity code.

The main idea behind this is to download the project and run it in the emulator with Talkback on (previous setup of Talkback),
and to modify the code at pleasure and test how the experience changes.

For more info on the creation of this initiative, setup and use of Talkback, a11y theory applied to Android
and other resources, you can refer to this [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G_QLdKQPTSj7yPUITenj7HyHOL7AVha7/view?usp=sharing),

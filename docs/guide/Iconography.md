# Iconography

The Andes UI library icons are small graphic representations with a great symbolic load. They compress meaning, highlight features, and help users navigate.

Consider the following points:

- You will not find all the icons of our Andes specification because we don't want to add weight to our library if it's not needed.
  
- We add icons based on your demand! So if you need an icon and it's not included please create a PR and notify to Andes dev team. Check an [example](https://github.com/mercadolibre/fury_andesui-android/pull/433).

- Unfortunately there are some name differences between an [icon in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/i275NVe7uWWkuQYnpYGVq8/02-Iconography?node-id=1%3A2142) and [in our repo](https://github.com/mercadolibre/fury_andesui-android/tree/master/components/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi).
